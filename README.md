## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture

FastBrowse uses Chrome Extension Manifest V3 with the following components:

- **Background Service Worker**: Handles tab management, memory monitoring, focus mode orchestration, and memory-aware restoration logic
- **Popup Interface**: Provides user interface for manual tab control, focus mode management, and restoration mode selection
- **Options Page**: Allows configuration of all settings including focus mode preferences and restoration behavior
- **Content Scripts**: Injected into web pages for focus mode distraction removal, theme application, and lite mode media blocking
- **Lite Mode Content Script**: Specialized script for blocking auto-playing videos, animations, and optimizing media-heavy pages
- **Chrome APIs Used**:
  - `chrome.tabs` - Tab management and discarding
  - `chrome.system.memory` - Memory usage monitoring
  - `chrome.storage` - Settings persistence across sessions
  - `chrome.notifications` - User notifications and alerts
  - `chrome.management` - Extension analysis and recommendations
  - `chrome.scripting` - Dynamic content script injection for focus mode
  - `chrome.offscreen` - Background audio playback for Focus Music (MV3-offscreen document)
  - `chrome.action` - Badge updates for actionable items
  - `activeTab` - Content script access for focus enhancements

### Memory Optimization Strategy

1. **Native Tab Discarding**: Uses Chrome's built-in `chrome.tabs.discard()` API, which is the same mechanism used by Chrome's Memory Saver feature
2. **Intelligent Protection**: Automatically identifies and protects important tabs:
   - Active tabs (currently in use)
   - Pinned tabs
   - Tabs playing audio or video
   - System pages (chrome://, chrome-extension://)
   - Tabs with unsaved form data (optional)
3. **Graduated Response**: 
   - Normal operation: Suspend tabs after configured delay
   - High memory usage: Emergency suspension of oldest inactive tabs
   - Memory critical: More aggressive suspension while respecting protections
4. **Smart Memory Alerts**:
   - Requires sustained high memory across checks
   - Suppresses alerts/actions unless Chrome had recent focus and there are enough unsuspended tabs
5. **Memory Compression for Suspended Tabs**:
   - Captures minimal state (URL, title, scroll position, non-sensitive form values)
   - Compresses and stores snapshot in `chrome.storage.local` (uses `CompressionStream` gzip/deflate when available; falls back to base64)
   - Restores state on resume and cleans up the stored snapshot
   - Never captures sensitive inputs (password/hidden)

### Memory-Aware Restoration Strategy

1. **Intelligent Mode Selection**:
   - **Smart Mode**: Analyzes memory usage, tab content type, and system state to automatically choose optimal restoration method
   - **Lite Mode**: Injects content script to block auto-playing videos, animations, and heavy media elements
   - **Full Mode**: Standard restoration without any optimization or restrictions
2. **Priority-Based Restoration**:
   - **Tab Scoring System**: Calculates priority based on pinned status (+100), recent access (+30), audio playback (+60), and tag importance
   - **Domain Classification**: Work domains (GitHub, Stack Overflow, docs) get higher priority (+25) than entertainment sites
   - **Smart Ordering**: Restores high-priority tabs first, media-heavy sites last or in lite mode
3. **Progressive Restoration**:
   - **Batched Processing**: Restores tabs in configurable batches (1-10 concurrent) with delays (500-5000ms)
   - **Memory Pressure Monitoring**: Pauses restoration when memory usage exceeds safe thresholds
   - **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates and notifications for large restoration operations
4. **Lite Mode Optimizations**:
   - **Media Blocking**: Replaces videos, GIFs, and auto-playing content with clickable placeholders
   - **Animation Disabling**: Removes CSS animations and transitions for performance
   - **Image Optimization**: Implements lazy loading and compression for off-screen images
   - **Site-Specific Rules**: Custom selectors for YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other media-heavy platforms

### Focus Mode Strategy

1. **Site-Specific Distraction Removal**: Uses curated CSS selectors for major platforms:
   - **YouTube**: Suggestions, comments, sidebars, end screens, and recommendations
   - **Social Media**: News feeds, trending sections, suggested content, and ads
   - **Professional Sites**: Marketing sections, promotional content, and non-essential sidebars
2. **Minimal UI Theme**: Applies consistent dark theme with:
   - Reduced visual noise and simplified color schemes
   - Optimized contrast for better readability and reduced eye strain
   - Consistent typography and spacing across all websites
3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - **Animation Disabling**: Removes CSS animations and transitions for better focus
   - **Image Optimization**: Compresses images and implements lazy loading for off-screen content
   - **Memory Reduction**: Unloads non-visible images and reduces resource consumption
4. **Extension Ecosystem Integration**:
   - **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests complementary extensions based on browsing patterns
   - **Priority System**: Ranks recommendations by effectiveness and user benefit
   - **Installation Assistance**: Direct links to Chrome Web Store for recommended extensions

### Performance Considerations

- **Minimal Background Activity**: Service worker only runs when needed
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Responds to tab changes rather than continuous polling
- **Efficient Memory Monitoring**: Checks memory usage every 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Clean Resource Management**: Properly disposes of timers and event listeners

### Network Optimization Strategy

1. **DNS Prefetching**
   - Scans anchors on the current page to find frequently linked external domains
   - Inserts `<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//domain">` for up to N domains (configurable)
2. **Connection Pre-warming**
   - Adds `<link rel="preconnect" href="https://domain" crossorigin>` for the top external domains by frequency
   - Helps reduce connection setup latency (DNS+TCP+TLS)
3. **Resource Preloading**
   - On link hover or pointer down, prefetches the target page via `<link rel="prefetch" as="document" href="...">`
   - Smartly throttled and deduplicated to avoid waste

Settings (Options ‚Üí Network Optimization):
- Enable Network Optimization
- DNS Prefetching: toggle + maximum hosts to prefetch
- Connection Pre-warming: toggle + number of top domains
- Resource Preloading: toggle prefetch on hover

### Page Load Acceleration

1. **Lazy Loading Override**
   - Forces lazy loading for images/iframes outside the initial viewport
   - Sets `decoding="async"` for images and `preload="metadata"` for below-the-fold videos
2. **Render-Blocking CSS Optimizer**
   - Heuristically defers non-critical stylesheets (cross-origin or known non-critical providers)
   - Uses `rel=preload as=style` and sets back to `rel=stylesheet` on load
   - Limit the number with ‚ÄúMax stylesheets to defer‚Äù to avoid FOUC
3. **JavaScript Deferral**
   - Safely defers known non-essential third-party scripts (analytics/ads). Aggressive mode defers any cross-origin script
   - Applies to `<script src>` without `async`/`defer`, leaves inline scripts intact

Settings (Options ‚Üí Page Load Acceleration):
- Enable Page Load Acceleration
- Lazy Loading Override toggle
- CSS Defer: toggle + max stylesheets
- JavaScript Deferral: toggle + mode (Safe/Aggressive)

### Memory Impact Testing

Use Chrome Task Manager (`Shift+Esc`) to monitor:
- Extension's own memory usage (should be minimal)
- Overall browser memory reduction after suspending tabs
- Memory usage recovery when tabs are restored

### State Snapshot/Restore Testing

1. Open a page with a form and scroll down
2. Type into non-sensitive inputs (text/textarea/select) and optionally checkboxes
3. Suspend the tab using the popup (or wait for auto-suspend)
4. Restore the tab (Full or Lite). After load:
   - Scroll position should be restored
   - Non-sensitive form values should be re-applied
5. Verify in background console for snapshot/restore logs; stored snapshot is removed after successful restore

## üö´ Limitations

- **Chrome Extension API Limitations**: Cannot suspend certain system pages or extensions
- **Active Tab Detection**: May occasionally suspend tabs that appear inactive but are actually in use
- **Memory API Accuracy**: System memory reporting may vary by operating system
- **Background Script Persistence**: Service worker may need to restart, causing brief delays
- **State Snapshot Scope**: Snapshot/restore cannot run on restricted pages (chrome://, chrome-extension://, etc.) and won‚Äôt store state for those tabs
- **Form State Coverage**: Only non-sensitive inputs are captured (password/hidden excluded); complex web app state outside standard form fields isn‚Äôt captured
- **Chrome Flags**: Extensions cannot programmatically modify chrome://flags. Use the Flags Management section to get safe recommendations and copy launch flags.
