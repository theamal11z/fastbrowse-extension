## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture

FastBrowse uses Chrome Extension Manifest V3 with the following components:

- **Background Service Worker**: Handles tab management, memory monitoring, and focus mode orchestration
- **Popup Interface**: Provides user interface for manual tab control and focus mode management
- **Options Page**: Allows configuration of all settings including focus mode preferences
- **Content Scripts**: Injected into web pages for focus mode distraction removal and theme application
- **Chrome APIs Used**:
  - `chrome.tabs` - Tab management and discarding
  - `chrome.system.memory` - Memory usage monitoring
  - `chrome.storage` - Settings persistence across sessions
  - `chrome.notifications` - User notifications and alerts
  - `chrome.management` - Extension analysis and recommendations
  - `chrome.scripting` - Dynamic content script injection for focus mode
  - `activeTab` - Content script access for focus enhancements

### Memory Optimization Strategy

1. **Native Tab Discarding**: Uses Chrome's built-in `chrome.tabs.discard()` API, which is the same mechanism used by Chrome's Memory Saver feature
2. **Intelligent Protection**: Automatically identifies and protects important tabs:
   - Active tabs (currently in use)
   - Pinned tabs
   - Tabs playing audio or video
   - System pages (chrome://, chrome-extension://)
   - Tabs with unsaved form data (optional)
3. **Graduated Response**: 
   - Normal operation: Suspend tabs after configured delay
   - High memory usage: Emergency suspension of oldest inactive tabs
   - Memory critical: More aggressive suspension while respecting protections

### Focus Mode Strategy

1. **Site-Specific Distraction Removal**: Uses curated CSS selectors for major platforms:
   - **YouTube**: Suggestions, comments, sidebars, end screens, and recommendations
   - **Social Media**: News feeds, trending sections, suggested content, and ads
   - **Professional Sites**: Marketing sections, promotional content, and non-essential sidebars
2. **Minimal UI Theme**: Applies consistent dark theme with:
   - Reduced visual noise and simplified color schemes
   - Optimized contrast for better readability and reduced eye strain
   - Consistent typography and spacing across all websites
3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - **Animation Disabling**: Removes CSS animations and transitions for better focus
   - **Image Optimization**: Compresses images and implements lazy loading for off-screen content
   - **Memory Reduction**: Unloads non-visible images and reduces resource consumption
4. **Extension Ecosystem Integration**:
   - **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests complementary extensions based on browsing patterns
   - **Priority System**: Ranks recommendations by effectiveness and user benefit
   - **Installation Assistance**: Direct links to Chrome Web Store for recommended extensions

### Performance Considerations

- **Minimal Background Activity**: Service worker only runs when needed
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Responds to tab changes rather than continuous polling
- **Efficient Memory Monitoring**: Checks memory usage every 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Clean Resource Management**: Properly disposes of timers and event listeners

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Extension loads without errors
- [ ] Popup displays current memory usage
- [ ] Tab list shows all open tabs with correct status
- [ ] Manual tab suspension/restoration works
- [ ] Automatic suspension works after configured delay
- [ ] Protected tabs (pinned, audio, active) are not suspended
- [ ] Memory threshold suspension triggers correctly
- [ ] Settings save and load properly

### Memory Impact Testing

Use Chrome Task Manager (`Shift+Esc`) to monitor:
